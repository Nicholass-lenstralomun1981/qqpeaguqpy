Oh WOW, I just walked out of the theater and my head is still spinning. The Phoenician Scheme was like a rollercoaster ride run by an octopus -- so many plot twists, tentacles everywhere. Crazy crowded theater – someone kept rustling snack bags, and I've got popcorn bits sneaking into places shouldn't be. Haven’t seen a   like it since forever, I think I’m gonna wear this dazed look all week.  

The scene where Sara confronts the villain — why is it always in a rainy alley? Like seriously, do bad guys have a Groupon for rainy nights or what? My back was killing me halfway through, those seats feel like they were borrowed from a medieval dungeon. But I couldn’t leave, the   just kind of sucked you in, like a vacuum designed by conspiracy theorists.  

> 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , they said, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , they said. But how could I have expected that mad ride? I’m torn between loving it and feeling like my brain just ran a marathon in stilettos. It's like a canvas where someone spilled all the paint and declared it Art, but, weirdly, it kind of worked? 

Remember when Sara’s car blew up out of nowhere? Just as I'm digging into my overpriced nachos, boom, chaos on screen and cheese in my lap. And the soundtrack, oh my gosh, was like if a cat and a piano fell down a flight of stairs together. But somehow, that's what made it all feel so intense, like snorkelling without a snorkel. 

And oh! don't even let me start on the scene where they discover the underwater cave. Made me feel like I was in two  s at once – one in a submarine and another in a telenovela. The logic was all over the place; like a toddler trying to explain calculus. But hey, who sits through an action-thriller for the logic?

_someFunction('𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩','analyze') {  
  this.state = undefined;  
  var popcorn = theater.squeakyChairs.popcornLeftover;  
  if (baffled && enthralled) {  
    emotions.explode();  
  }  
  return world.dazed;  
}  

How did a piece of JavaScript code even slip in here? Need to pay more attention when tab-hopping. Anyways, that’s The Phoenician Scheme for you — a whirlwind!
